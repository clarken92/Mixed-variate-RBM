# Mixed-variate RBM

This is an implementation of standard RBMs, Mixed-variate RBMs and sparse RBMs in Python/Theano which was used in the paper:

"**_Outlier Detection on Mixed-Type Data: An Energy-based Approach_**" (Kien Do, Truyen Tran, Dinh Phung, Svetha Venkatesh, ADMA 2016)

Later, I will update the code of Convolutional RBM (written entirely in Theano) which based on the code of Honglak Lee (in Matlab) used
in this paper: "_Convolutional deep belief networks for scalable unsupervised learning of hierarchical representations_". Note that for this model, a custom Ops called _Probabilistic Max Pooling_ would be defined in Theano.
