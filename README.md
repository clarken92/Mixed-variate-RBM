# Mixed-variate-RBM

This is an implementation of standard RBM, Mixed-variate RBM and sparse RBM in Python/Theano which was used in the paper:

"**_Outlier Detection on Mixed-Type Data: An Energy-based Approach_**" (Kien Do, Truyen Tran, Dinh Phung, Svetha Venkatesh, ADMA 2016)

Link Arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04830

Later, I will update the code of Convolutional RBM (written entirely in Theano) which based on the code of Honglak Lee (in Matlab) used
in this paper: _Convolutional deep belief networks for scalable unsupervised learning of hierarchical representations_.
